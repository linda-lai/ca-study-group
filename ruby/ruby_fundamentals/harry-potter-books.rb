# Once upon a time there was a series of 5* books about a very English hero called Harry. Children all over the world thought he was fantastic, and, of course, so did the publisher. So in a gesture of immense generosity to mankind, (and to increase sales) they set up the following pricing model to take advantage of Harry’s magical powers.
# One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR.
# If, however, you buy two different books from the series, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
# If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
# With 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
# If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.
# Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.
# Potter mania is sweeping the country and parents of teenagers everywhere are queueing up with shopping baskets overflowing with Potter books.
# Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket, giving as big a discount as possible.
# An example case,
# For example, how much does this basket of books cost?
# • 2 copies of the first book
# • 2 copies of the second book
# • 2 copies of the third book
# • 1 copy of the fourth book
# • 1 copy of the fifth book
