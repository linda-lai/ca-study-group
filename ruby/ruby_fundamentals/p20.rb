# *Problem 20*
# Using some of the features in the past couple of problems, start thinking about it coding a basic PTV app (like our public transport app, if you aren't familiar). I'm happy to give hints, or you can get together and help each other. 

# You need to simplify things, so only dummy up one or at most two lines at first (or at last). The final product (coded, or just pseudo-coded) 

# would take a user input of an origin station, and a destination station. 

# Start with one train line, represented by an array. If you extend it to two lines, you need to think about how to represent the lines as data, and this might be a complex object. Think through all the options. 
# You will need some way to carry the user data through the method/s, and some way to represent the MTR. You will likely need several small methods, and will likely have to employ a full range of data types, such as hashes and arrays (and possibly arrays of arrays). 

# I am more than happy to help out anyone stuck, particularly if they have a specific question where they are stuck, and have thought about it. I'm also happy to look through code people would like examined.
